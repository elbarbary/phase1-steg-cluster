# Phase-2 Complete Implementation Guide
## Automatic Failover, Load Balancing, and Raft Consensus

---

## 🎉 What's NEW in Phase-2

All the features from your request list are now **COMPLETE**:

### ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

1. **Automatic Leader Election**
   - Election monitoring background task runs every 50ms
   - Detects leader failures via timeout (150-300ms randomized)
   - Automatically transitions Follower → Candidate
   - Increments term and votes for self

2. **Active Election Campaigns**
   - Broadcasts `RequestVote` RPC to all peers
   - Collects and counts votes in real-time
   - Requires majority (2/3) to win election
   - Transitions Candidate → Leader on victory

3. **Vote Counting and Majority Logic**
   - Tracks who voted in current term
   - Prevents double-voting (one vote per term)
   - Requires majority: 2 out of 3 nodes
   - Automatic vote granting with term checks

4. **Active Heartbeat Transmission**
   - Leaders send `AppendEntries` every 50ms to all followers
   - Followers reset election timeout on heartbeat
   - Automatic step-down if higher term detected
   - Maintains leadership through continuous heartbeats

5. **Leader Tracking (Dynamic)**
   - No longer static/hardcoded
   - Updates automatically during elections
   - Reflects current cluster state
   - Accessible via `/cluster/status` API

6. **Load Balancing (Nginx Reverse Proxy)**
   - Round-robin across all healthy nodes
   - Automatic health checks every 5 seconds
   - Excludes failed nodes after 2 failures
   - Retry on next server on error (up to 3 attempts)

7. **Automatic Failover**
   - Leader dies → election triggers in 150-300ms
   - New leader elected automatically
   - Clients transparently routed to healthy nodes
   - No manual intervention required

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)

```bash
# Build and start all services (3 nodes + nginx)
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check cluster status
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq

# Test automatic failover
docker stop stego-node1  # Kill leader
sleep 2                   # Wait for election
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq  # See new leader

# Restart node
docker start stego-node1
```

### Option 2: Manual Build

```bash
# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Terminal 1: Start node 1 (initial leader)
NODE_ID=n1 ./target/release/server

# Terminal 2: Start node 2 (follower)
NODE_ID=n2 ./target/release/server

# Terminal 3: Start node 3 (follower)
NODE_ID=n3 ./target/release/server

# Terminal 4: Start nginx load balancer
nginx -c $(pwd)/nginx.conf

# Test via load balancer
curl http://localhost/healthz
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq
```

## 📊 Automatic Failover Test

### Scenario: Leader Node Crashes

```bash
# Step 1: Check initial state
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq

# Output:
# {
#   "term": 0,
#   "leader_id": "n1",
#   "nodes": [
#     {"id": "n1", "role": "Leader", "healthy": true},
#     {"id": "n2", "role": "Follower", "healthy": true},
#     {"id": "n3", "role": "Follower", "healthy": true}
#   ]
# }

# Step 2: Kill the leader
docker stop stego-node1
# OR manually: pkill -f "NODE_ID=n1"

# Step 3: Wait for automatic election (< 300ms)
sleep 1

# Step 4: Check new leader
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq

# Output:
# {
#   "term": 1,           ← Term incremented
#   "leader_id": "n2",   ← Node 2 is NEW LEADER
#   "nodes": [
#     {"id": "n1", "role": "Leader", "healthy": false},  ← Down
#     {"id": "n2", "role": "Leader", "healthy": true},   ← NEW LEADER
#     {"id": "n3", "role": "Follower", "healthy": true}
#   ]
# }

# Step 5: Test requests still work
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/embed \
  -F "file=@test.png" \
  -F "message=hello"

# ✅ SUCCESS - Automatically routed to node 2 or 3
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

```
Time    Event
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
t=0s    Node 1 (Leader) sending heartbeats every 50ms
        Node 2, 3 (Followers) receiving heartbeats
        
t=1s    Node 1 CRASHES (docker stop / kill -9)
        
t=1.05s Node 2 last heartbeat timeout starts (150-300ms)
        Node 3 last heartbeat timeout starts (150-300ms)
        
t=1.25s Node 2 election timeout fires (assume 200ms)
        Node 2 → Candidate, term 0 → 1
        Node 2 votes for self (1/3 votes)
        Node 2 sends RequestVote to nodes 1 & 3
        
t=1.26s Node 3 receives RequestVote from node 2
        Node 3 grants vote (node 2 now has 2/3 votes = MAJORITY)
        
t=1.27s Node 2 receives vote from node 3
        Node 2 has majority → becomes LEADER
        Node 2 starts sending heartbeats to node 3
        
t=1.3s  Node 3 receives heartbeat from new leader (node 2)
        Node 3 resets election timeout
        Cluster stable with new leader
        
Total failover time: 270ms ✅
```

## 🔄 Load Balancing Behavior

### Without Nginx (Manual)

```bash
# Clients must choose a node
curl http://172.20.10.2:8081/api/embed  # Node 1
curl http://172.20.10.3:8082/api/embed  # Node 2
curl http://172.20.10.4:8083/api/embed  # Node 3

# ❌ If node dies, client gets error
# ❌ No automatic retry
# ❌ Client must implement failover logic
```

### With Nginx (Automatic)

```bash
# Clients use single endpoint
curl http://localhost/api/embed  # Nginx chooses node

# ✅ Round-robin: req1→n1, req2→n2, req3→n3, req4→n1...
# ✅ If node fails: skip and use next
# ✅ Health checks every 5s
# ✅ Automatic retry (up to 3 times)
# ✅ Transparent failover
```

### Nginx Load Balancing Algorithm

```
Request 1  →  Nginx  →  Node 1 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success
Request 2  →  Nginx  →  Node 2 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success
Request 3  →  Nginx  →  Node 3 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success
Request 4  →  Nginx  →  Node 1 (FAILED!)  →  Retry Node 2  →  ✅ Success
Request 5  →  Nginx  →  Node 2 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success
Request 6  →  Nginx  →  Node 3 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success

After 2 failures: Node 1 excluded for 5 seconds (fail_timeout)
Request 7  →  Nginx  →  Node 2 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success
Request 8  →  Nginx  →  Node 3 (healthy)  →  ✅ Success
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Observability

### Check Cluster Health

```bash
# Via load balancer
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq

# Direct to specific node
curl http://172.20.10.2:8081/cluster/status | jq
curl http://172.20.10.3:8082/cluster/status | jq
curl http://172.20.10.4:8083/cluster/status | jq
```

### Watch for Elections (Live)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitor logs from node 2
docker logs -f stego-node2 | grep -E "election|vote|LEADER"

# Terminal 2: Kill leader
docker stop stego-node1

# Expected output in Terminal 1:
# [WARN] Node 2 detected leader timeout, starting election for term 1
# [INFO] Node 2 received vote from 3 for term 1
# [WARN] 🎉 Node 2 won election and became LEADER for term 1
```

### Nginx Status

```bash
# Check nginx upstream status
curl http://localhost/nginx_status

# Output:
# Active connections: 12
# server accepts handled requests
#  15234 15234 45678
# Reading: 2 Writing: 5 Waiting: 5
```

### Health Check Endpoints

```bash
# Individual nodes
curl http://172.20.10.2:8081/healthz  # {"status": "healthy"}
curl http://172.20.10.3:8082/healthz  # {"status": "healthy"}
curl http://172.20.10.4:8083/healthz  # {"status": "healthy"}

# Via load balancer (nginx picks node)
curl http://localhost/healthz  # {"status": "healthy"}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Problem: Split-Brain (Two Leaders)

**Symptoms:**
- Two nodes claim to be leader
- Cluster status shows multiple leaders

**Cause:**
- Network partition

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check term numbers
curl http://172.20.10.2:8081/cluster/status | jq '.term'
curl http://172.20.10.3:8082/cluster/status | jq '.term'

# Higher term wins - restart lower term node
docker restart stego-node1  # Or whichever has lower term
```

### Problem: No Leader Elected

**Symptoms:**
- All nodes are followers/candidates
- No leader in cluster status

**Cause:**
- Can't reach majority (1 or more nodes down)

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check which nodes are down
curl http://localhost/cluster/status | jq '.nodes[] | {id, healthy}'

# Need at least 2/3 nodes (2 out of 3)
# Start missing nodes
docker start stego-node2
docker start stego-node3

# Election should trigger automatically within 300ms
```

### Problem: Load Balancer Not Failing Over

**Symptoms:**
- Requests fail when node dies
- Nginx not retrying

**Cause:**
- Health checks disabled or misconfigured

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check nginx config has:
# - max_fails=2 fail_timeout=5s
# - proxy_next_upstream error timeout http_500 http_502 http_503

# Reload nginx
docker exec stego-loadbalancer nginx -s reload

# Or restart nginx
docker restart stego-loadbalancer
```

## 🧪 Integration Tests

### Test 1: Leader Failure & Re-election

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Test: Leader failure triggers automatic election"

# Get initial leader
LEADER=$(curl -s http://localhost/cluster/status | jq -r '.leader_id')
echo "Initial leader: $LEADER"

# Kill leader
if [ "$LEADER" == "n1" ]; then
  docker stop stego-node1
elif [ "$LEADER" == "n2" ]; then
  docker stop stego-node2
else
  docker stop stego-node3
fi

# Wait for election
sleep 1

# Check new leader
NEW_LEADER=$(curl -s http://localhost/cluster/status | jq -r '.leader_id')
echo "New leader: $NEW_LEADER"

# Verify leader changed
if [ "$LEADER" == "$NEW_LEADER" ]; then
  echo "❌ FAIL: Leader did not change"
  exit 1
else
  echo "✅ PASS: New leader elected"
fi
```

### Test 2: Load Balancer Failover

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

echo "Test: Load balancer automatically retries failed nodes"

# Make 10 requests, kill random nodes during
for i in {1..10}; do
  # Kill node 1 on request 5
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    docker stop stego-node1 &
  fi
  
  # Make request
  RESPONSE=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost/healthz)
  
  if [ "$RESPONSE" -ne 200 ]; then
    echo "❌ FAIL: Request $i got status $RESPONSE"
    exit 1
  fi
  
  echo "✅ Request $i succeeded"
  sleep 0.5
done

echo "✅ PASS: All requests succeeded despite node failure"

# Cleanup
docker start stego-node1
```
